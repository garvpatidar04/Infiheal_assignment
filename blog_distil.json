5some possible causes hormone fluctuations social and environmental factors anticipation an unresolved issue you aren't aware of there are a variety of things that can cause a person to feel anxious for no apparent reason says brown for example women are more likely to experience intrusive thoughts due to fluctuations in hormones she describes social and environmental factors such as childhood trauma lack of resources limited socialization stressful work school and home life situations can also make someone vulnerable to anxiety mysterious bouts of anxiety can be confusing because sometimes they are actually triggered by something positive or the anticipation of something positive happening in the future for example someone might feel anxious about an upcoming trip despite loving travel says goldberg their body however might react similarly to excitement as it does to fear which can confuse the person to attribute their symptoms to anxiety rather than positive anticipation another common cause is an unresolved issue that you may not be aware of consciously perhaps you had a tif f with their partner and although you both apologized and hugged before parting ways there may still be unresolved feelings from the argument goldberg describes additionally learned responses from past traumas can be triggered by things that you aren t consciously aware of goldberg adds finally you

mental health professional during a mixed state i feel trapped in my body i m a licensed social worker who has been living with schizoaf fective disorder bipolar type for over a decade schizoaf fective disorder is basically like if schizophrenia and bipolar disorder had a baby i experience psychotic symptoms as well as mood symptoms mood disorders can be upsetting and scary both for those living with them and the people around them here i ll explain my mood symptoms depression mania hypomania and mixed states and share what it s like living with a mood disorder a quick explanation for most people with a mood disorder like bipolar disorder or schizoaf fective disorder depressive and manic episodes can last a few weeks a few months or more however i experience something called rapid cycling when i have a mood episode it generally lasts anywhere from a few hours to a few days although my depressive and manic symptoms are the same as others whose episodes last longer this rapid cycling sets my experiences apart from most people living with a mood disorder my depression many people experience depression in their lifetimes but the dif ference between someone who has experienced a depressive episode and someone who has a mood disorder like bipolar or schizoaf fective disorder is that the depressive episodes are recurring by hannah owens lmsw updated on march 21 20247 29 24 verywellmind com what its like to have a mood disorder 8603015 print 1 10i never know when a depressive episode is going to hit or how long it will last when it does this uncertainty makes it especially frightening what depression can look like depression can look like many things personally when i m experiencing depression i am visibly slowed down it s difficult to talk and people notice that i m speaking slower and more laboriously than usual all i want to do is sleep and i often have episodes where i cry uncontrollably these crying bouts can hit suddenly and hard they often take me by surprise and leave me sobbing for anywhere from a few minutes to hours they ve hit me at work at school and at home when i m surrounded by people or by myself back when i was studying acting in college and i would cry like this my teachers used to tell me to use that feeling i tried explaining to them that i couldn t use it because it wasn t really me crying but no one ever understood that when i m depressed it also becomes very dif ficult to think it s like i m on a 10 second delay i can t process information as quickly as i can when i m not feeling depressed and this is incredibly frustrating when i was in grad school i spent almost the entirety of my first semester in a serious depressive episode this led me to seek accommodations for some of my more lecture heavy classes where i felt i just couldn t keep up luckily my professors were very kind and understanding but having to work through a deep depression like that was draining both mentally and physically i also feel my depression in my body my chest feels like a cavernous hole and my body feels heavy it s like i m imploding my chest is a black hole that s pulling me and everything around me into it and from which i can t escape i feel literally hollow favoring depression i have far more depressive episodes than manic or hypomanic episodes people often favor one over the other but the presence of both depression and mania are necessary for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizoaf fective disorder bipolar type verywellmind com what its like to have a mood disorder 8603015 print 2 10 reach out if you re depressed it might seem hopeless to reach out for support you might feel as though nothing will ever change or that people won t understand what you re going through i m here to tell you reach out anyway you might be surprised how many people love you and want you to feel better i ve been fortunate enough to have parents who are incredibly supportive a boyfriend who wants to take care of me when i am feeling bad and friends who have always been there for me but you won t know how many people want to help you until you ask you don t have to suf fer alone let's talk about suicidality the severity of my depressive episodes changes i ve experienced everything from mild depression times when it s hard to get out of bed and stay motivated to making a plan to kill myself suicidality is something that has often accompanied my depression and it s something that s difficult to talk about especially with people who have never been suicidal themselves at its core suicidality does not make sense we are programmed to fight for survival but if you are experiencing suicidal thoughts or urges dying suddenly makes more sense than living it s a deep inexplicable almost physical conviction that i feel throughout my entire being that s what makes the often used adage suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem so dif ficult and infuriating to hear when i m suicidal it goes beyond problem solving it goes beyond logic and it goes beyond explanation luckily i have always been able to muster up the presence of mind to reach out to a professional when i am suicidal whether that s my therapist or a crisis hotline and i ve never made an attempt but i have had to ask a roommate to hide my medication from me so that i didn t intentionally overdose if you are feeling suicidal tell someone verywellmind com what its like to have a mood disorder 8603015 print 3 10if you have a therapist or psychiatrist reach out to them they might be able to of fer you extra sessions to help support you while you are feeling this way and they can work with you to set up a safety plan tell a trusted friend or family member what you are experiencing and ask them if it would be alright if you called them or spent time with them when you are feeling like you want to kill yourself get help no w if you do not want to tell a loved one what you re going through or if there is no one you trust with that information reach out to a crisis hotline 988 is the national suicide and crisis lifeline and the crisis text line is reachable if you text home to 741741 988 people who talk about their suicidality are less likely to go through with it set yourself up with a network of people you trust so that you re not dealing with these feelings alone my mania mania is a mental state where your energy is heightened and your thoughts race and it s often accompanied by almost delusional levels of self esteem and confidence as well as little to no regard for consequences and a diminished need for sleep these things make manic episodes potentially dangerous people often report excessive spending and risky behavior like hypersexuality for example i ve experienced both i had a particular predilection for dropping hundreds of dollars at a time at v ictoria s secret when i was manic which aided and abetted the subsequent risky sexual behavior when i m manic i want to talk i want to talk a lot i m usually a pretty quiet person but during my manic episodes it s like a switch gets flipped and i am on i ve spent hours calling friend after friend and talking at light speed about absolutely nothing often in fact my thoughts are whizzing in and out of my mind so fast that what i am saying doesn t actually make any sense it s like my mouth can t keep up with my brain verywellmind com what its like to have a mood disorder 8603015 print 4 10mania for me is all about pressure i feel physical pressure in my body and my brain to go go go go go it s incredibly dif ficult to temper my words and actions and i feel as though i m crawling out of my skin while some people can stay in manic episodes for days weeks or months mine are usually very short much shorter than my depressive episodes tend to be my mania usually lasts anywhere from about 45 minutes to a few hours and it s always accompanied by what i call a crash without fail the end of one of my manic episodes is a sudden and deep depression where i have a crying spell like the ones i described it s like i ve just stepped of f the side of a clif f one moment i am high as a kite and the next i m in a pit of despair this despair can either be a one time af fair where i cry for a while and then reach some sort of equilibrium or it can lead to a longer depressive episode coping with mania mania can seem uncontrollable while it's happening and embarrassing after the fact you might have said or done some things that later in the cold light of day you wish you hadn t you might not even remember what happened during your manic episode but talking with loved ones about setting up a plan for when you re manic can help you can enlist others to help establish boundaries and keep you safe from yourself you might say to a loved one let s set up a plan for when i m having a manic episode if i call you when i m manic please remind me that it s not a good time to go shopping if i m manic can you come hang out with me to make sure i don t do anything i regret when i m manic i tend to say things i don t mean please don t take it personally if i say something strange to you chances are your loved ones will be willing and eager to help you if they re not if they seem afraid or angry that s a good opportunity to educate them about your condition what you experience and what you need from them my hypomania i was misdiagnosed with bipolar ii disorder for many years while bipolar i disorder is characterized by true manic episodes bipolar ii s manic episodes are actually7 29 24 verywellmind com what its like to have a mood disorder 8603015 print 5 10hypomania hypomania is a less intense form of mania there s less of a chance of risky or dangerous behavior there s little delusion involved and it doesn t necessarily af fect your sleep while i find manic episodes to be exhausting and deeply uncomfortable hypomania in my experience can actually be fun sometimes i feel buoyed and light and while my energy is definitely increased and my thoughts are faster than normal i don t experience the crawling out of my skin feeling hypomania for me generally just means that i m in an unusually good and chatty mood for a few hours it also isn t accompanied by the crash of a manic episode i tend to just even out after a while hypomania isn t all great though i ve definitely had hypomanic episodes where i ve said things i shouldn t have i tend to be disruptive and voice opinions that i otherwise would have kept to myself sometimes it comes across as funny but often it s awkward i usually still end up regretting my actions my mixed states last but certainly not least are my mixed states out of all my mood symptoms i hate mixed states the most a mixed state is when you have the energy of mania or hypomania but the low mood of depression it s actually in mixed states that most people with bipolar disorder die by suicide you are emotionally compelled to make a plan and have the energy to go through with it mixed states are nefarious and dangerous and incredibly unbearably uncomfortable during a mixed state i feel trapped in my body my hands hurt and my chest feels tight like there s a boa constrictor squeezing the life out of me at the same time it feels like my body is being pulled apart like it wants to go everywhere at once but i feel so depressed that all i can do is curl up in the fetal position and try to keep my body together until it passes when i first started having really bad symptoms over a decade ago i spent a lot of time in mixed states during these episodes i found that i was often calling my7 29 24 verywellmind com what its like to have a mood disorder 8603015 print 6 10parents especially my dad i would go outside and walk around for hours because sitting still felt unbearable crying on the phone because i was so uncomfortable my parents listened to me with patience and empathy and i don t know what i would have done without their support who you choose to call when you're feeling bad can make a world of dif ference for example my mom was too emotionally involved in what i was feeling it made me feel guilty to call her when i was symptomatic because it upset her so much my dad was able to be more objective with me and i felt i could share more freely with him it might take some trial and error to find your best point person but don't give up all this to say use the resources that you've got family friends partners they all love you and want you to be well tell them what you re going through so that they understand you may not find solutions to your problems but you don t have to deal with those problems alone my challenges i ve experienced mood symptoms for years and years at first i was misdiagnosed with clinical depression but looking back there were definitely stretches of time where i existed on three hours of sleep a night and made unrealistic but glorious plans that i abandoned as quickly as they cropped up classic mania these are some snapshots of the challenges i've faced as someone living with a mood disorder i was on lithium considered the gold standard in treating bipolar disorder for eight years but all it did for me was destroy my kidneys and leave me with stage 3b chronic kidney disease the psychiatrist i worked with for many years had me take an experimental type of ketamine to treat my depression whenever i reported that i was still experiencing depressive symptoms all he did was increase the dose which meant that every other night i took so much ketamine that i went into a k hole7 29 24 verywellmind com what its like to have a mood disorder 8603015 print 7 10and literally felt like i was dying every single time i should have fired him so much sooner than i did i was told in college by a teacher in that same acting program that i was only funny because i was depressed this made me feel like my worth was directly tied to my mental illness and that paradoxically getting better would mean i was no longer good at my job i read the entire hunger games book series in three days and then immediately sat down in the middle of the night and wrote 100 pages of a novel in a desperate pressured fervor i've hidden in the bathroom crying at work more times than i can count and although i am finally in a place now with the help of some great therapists and psychiatrists where depressive episodes are few and far between and i am hardly ever manic or hypomanic i still live every day with the fear that i could wake up the next morning and not be myself and my successes despite being intensely symptomatic nearly every day i graduated from nyu s graduate social work program with a 4 0 i made it through two intense clinical internships where i worked with people who were living with the same kinds of serious mental illness that i was half the time i felt like i was an imposter because i was experiencing the same things that the people i was there to help were experiencing and half the time i felt no one was better suited than i was to treat these people because i knew exactly how they were feeling ultimately though my experiences with mood disorders have given me the empathy and understanding to approach my work be it clinical work with patients or my work as a mental health editor with care insight and a personal connection that drives me to try to help people like me the many faces of mood disorders just as with any mental illness my mood symptoms are unique to me and do not necessarily represent others experiences not everyone rapid cycles most people with bipolar disorder experience their manic or depressive symptoms for much longer periods of time than i do i am also on dif ferent medication than most people with bipolar disorder verywellmind com what its like to have a mood disorder 8603015 print 8 10for many who experience mania traditional antidepressants can actually cause manic or hypomanic episodes but because i do not have bipolar disorder and instead have schizoaf fective disorder things really turned around for me when i started taking an antidepressant along with an antipsychotic at my first job out of grad school i worked closely with a woman who regularly experienced suicidal depression so much so that she was frequently hospitalized for most months of the year my own experiences with depression and suicidality helped me foster a strong bond with this woman because while my fellow coworkers could not understand her feelings and compulsions i absolutely could w e spoke openly about her symptoms and i was able to approach our relationship without judgment unfortunately when i left that job she happened to be in the hospital again after another bout with suicidality i regret to this day that i was unable to continue our work together or even say goodbye my own experiences also helped me recognize when a diagnosis was incorrect at the day program i worked at through one of my internships one of the participants i was assigned was an older black lady who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder however after working with her for just a few weeks it became clear to me that this diagnosis was incorrect she also had an intellectual disability and when i spoke to her plainly about her bipolar symptoms she recited a speech about mood swings that someone had clearly drilled into her when i asked her about these swings whether she sometimes felt very very sad or sometimes felt very very energized she had nothing to say other than i get angry sometimes ultimately this turned out to be a very complicated situation because the disability benefits that she and her sister who was her caretaker received were based on a bipolar diagnosis and we didn t want to negatively af fect her only source of financial support still i left with the satisfaction that my own symptoms had allowed me to recognize an injustice final thoughts as someone who has lived with a mood disorder for more than 15 years i understand how dif ficult life can be for both those with mood disorders and their loved ones i ve7 29 24 verywellmind com what its like to have a mood disorder 8603015 print 9

what are mood episodes people with bipolar disorder may experience periods of unusually intense emotion changes in energy and activity levels and uncharacteristic behaviors these distinct periods are called mood episodes there are three main mood episodes that characterize bipolar disorders 1 manic during a manic episode you may feel extremely energized and happy or sometimes even unusually angry or irritable you feel like you have extra energy to burn this period generally needs to last at least one week to be diagnosed 2 hypomanic less severe manic episodes are called hypomania hypomanic episodes only need to be present for four days for the diagnosis to be made 3 depressive a major depressive episode is a period of at least two weeks during which you experience five or more

diagnosis bipolar ii disorder bipolar ii disorder is characterized by having both hypomanic and depressive episodes also to be diagnosed with bipolar ii you must never have experienced a full blown manic episode bipolar ii is not simply a milder form of bipolar i disorder it is a distinctively dif ferent disorder cyclothymic disorder also called cyclothymia this mood disorder consists of numerous alternating periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms unlike bipolar i and ii disorders the highs and lows of cyclothymia are not severe enough to fit the full criteria for manic hypomanic

when you have symptoms of bipolar disorder but they don't fit into other bipolar categories for instance you may have cyclothymic symptoms that haven't lasted two years or maybe you have hypomanic episodes without depressive episodes unspecified bipolar and related disorder this diagnosis is similar to specified bipolar and related disorder it's used when a doctor doesn't have enough

to tell a doctor about all the symptoms you ve been experiencing treatment treatment for any bipolar disorder generally involves medications and some form of psychotherapy medications medication is

a mood stabilizer examples of mood stabilizers include lithium depakote tegretol antidepressants may be prescribed for depressive episodes in bipolar disorder common antidepressants include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as zoloft prozac or lexapro because antidepressants can trigger manic episodes they tend to be avoided in bipolar i disorder and are generally prescribed along with
